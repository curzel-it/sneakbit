Then came the cataclysm. The skies darkened, the rivers dried, and the mountains began to wither.

The lush greenery gave way to scorched earth, and the proud peaks became lifeless dunes.

They built the great solar farm atop the barren heights, harnessing the unrelenting sun to power distant lands.

The Silver Legacy of Maritide Haven
Maritide Haven, once the jewel of the Silver Coast, owed its prosperity to the rich veins of silver buried deep beneath its rocky terrain.
The mine, a marvel of engineering and determination, provided wealth and trade to the region for centuries.
Merchants from distant lands would dock at its bustling port, their ships laden with goods to exchange for Maritide's famed silver ingots.
Yet, the very ground that promised such riches also whispered ominous warnings.
Tales of strange tremors and ghostly winds from the mine’s depths were dismissed as mere superstition by those who sought fortune.

Then, the same cataclysm that destroyed Thermoria, transformed this thriving island into a fragmented memory of its former self.
The collapse of the mine swallowed much of the settlement into the earth, leaving only scattered islets in its wake.
Today, Maritide Haven clings to survival as a humble fishing village, its wind turbines silently spinning over waters that once teemed with merchant fleets.
The mine, now sealed, serves as a grim monument to the dangers of human ambition and the unknown forces lurking in the deep.

These particles, once drawn into the tree's intricate vascular system, undergo a natural process akin to photosynthesis but far more extraordinary.
The tree converts these particles into pure mana, which radiates through its leaves, casting a subtle, luminescent glow.
