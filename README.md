Please consider buying the game to support the project üôè

Available now on [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/3360860/SneakBit) for Windows and macOS, support for Linux coming soon!

## Features
* Adventure-action gameplay with kunai and sword combat
* Grid-based tiling system with biomes and constructions
* Unlockable combat skills
* Nostalgic Gameboy-like pixel art aesthetics
* Local co-op multiplayer mode for PC
* Coming soon! Linux / Steam Deck support

## Build from source
### macOS, Linux
```bash
# Run the game
cargo run --package game

# Run the game in creative mode to build levels
cargo run --package game creative
```

### Cross-Compile from macOS for Windows
```bash
# Setup
rustup target add x86_64-pc-windows-gnu
brew install mingw-w64

# Build
cargo build --package game --release --target x86_64-pc-windows-gnu
```

### iOS and Android
The engine is the same, the rendering is a simple set of custom views for the game itself, menus and such

The `game_core` create is compiled via `cargo-lipo` and `cargo-ndk`.

The `build_all.sh` script will build `game_core`, compile all resources and copy them to the correct folders for both mobile projects.
```bash
sh scripts/build_all.sh
```

### Windows
The project uses [Raylib](https://docs.rs/raylib/latest/raylib/), so there are some extra steps after setting up Rust.

Personally (but I have no idea what I'm doing and haven't used a windows machine in 10+ years) I did the following:
1. Installed CMake from [here](https://cmake.org/download/)
2. Added CMake to path
3. Installed LLVM via `winget install LLVM.LLVM`
4. `cargo run --package game`
