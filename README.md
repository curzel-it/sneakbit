Coming soon to the Play Store for Android and to Steam for Linux, Windows and macOS.

Please consider buying the game from any store to support the project üôè

## Build from source
### macOS, Linux
```bash
# Run the game
cargo run --package game

# Run the game in creative mode to build levels
cargo run --package game creative
```

### Windows
The project uses [Raylib](https://docs.rs/raylib/latest/raylib/), so you will need to setup and add to path cmake, libc and the usual stuff before running the steps above.

Personally (but I have no idea what I'm doing and haven't used a windows machine in 10+ years) I did the following:
1. Installed CMake from [here](https://cmake.org/download/)
2. Added CMake to path
3. Installed LLVM via `winget install LLVM.LLVM`
4. `cargo run --package game` 

### iOS and Android
The engine is the same, the rendering is a simple set of custom views for the game itself, menus and such

The `game_core` create is compiled via `cargo-lipo` and `cargo-ndk`.

The `build_all.sh` script will build `game_core`, compile all resources and copy them to the correct folders for both mobile projects.
```bash
sh scripts/build_all.sh
```
