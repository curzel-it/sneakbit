## Features
* Adventure-action gameplay with kunai and sword combat
* Grid-based dual-layer tiling system
* Unlockable combat skills
* Nostalgic Gameboy-like pixel art aesthetics
* Local co-op multiplayer mode for PC
* Coming soon! Linux & SteamOS support

## Build from source
### macOS, Linux
```bash
# Run the game
cargo run --package game

# Run the game in creative mode to build levels
cargo run --package game creative
```

### Cross-Compile from macOS for Windows
```bash
# Setup
rustup target add x86_64-pc-windows-gnu
brew install mingw-w64

# Build
cargo build --package game --release --target x86_64-pc-windows-gnu
```

### iOS and Android
The engine is the same, the rendering is a simple set of custom views for the game itself, menus and such

The `game_core` create is compiled via `cargo-lipo` and `cargo-ndk`.

The `build_all.sh` script will build `game_core`, compile all resources and copy them to the correct folders for both mobile projects.
```bash
sh scripts/build_all.sh
```

### Windows
The project uses [Raylib](https://docs.rs/raylib/latest/raylib/), so there are some extra steps after setting up Rust.

Personally (but I have no idea what I'm doing and haven't used a windows machine in 10+ years) I did the following:
1. Installed CMake from [here](https://cmake.org/download/)
2. Added CMake to path
3. Installed LLVM via `winget install LLVM.LLVM`
4. `cargo run --package game`

|--|--|--|--|
| UP | `Arrow Up` or `W` | `Left Side / Up` or `Left Joystick` | Drag gesture |
| RIGHT | `Arrow Right` or `D` | `Left Side / Right` or `Left Joystick` | Drag gesture |
| DOWN | `Arrow Down` or `S` | `Left Side / Down` or `Left Joystick` | Drag gesture |
| LEFT | `Arrow Left` or `A` | `Left Side / Left` or `Left Joystick` | Drag gesture |

### Multiplayer
* Local co-op available only on PC
* Requires using one controller per player
* Player one can still use the keyboard (but still requires a controller)

#### Notes:
* Keyboard and Gamepad are only supported on PC
* On mobile "dedicated buttons" show up only when applicable, for example, the "fire" button only shows up if you have ammo.
* Controller is only supported on desktop
* Connecting or disconnecting a controller automatically pauses the game
* Cursor is automatically hidden when connecting a controller and when entering fullscreen
