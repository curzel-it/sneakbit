# Game Design Document
> Warning!<br>
> This document contains game spoilers, lots of AI generated slope and it's garbage in general.

## Overview
The game combines adventure and action elements, allowing players to explore a world populated by demons and to engage in combat with unique mechanics. The player can throw kunai (small knives) to defeat or weaken demonic creatures encountered throughout various landscapes, immersing the player in a journey with elements of both strategy and action wrapped in a gameboy-like pixel art aesthetics.
Local co-op is also available on PC.

## Tiling System
The game operates on a grid-based tile system.
There are two types of tiles:
* Biomes, which act as a background (water, grass, lava, rocky pavement, parquet, ...)
* Constructions, which act as a second layer of elements on the map

Both kinds of tiles can represent an obstacle, the player cannot walk on water, lava and over fences for example, but can walk over grass.
To mimic the effect of density, different construction tiles have different properties, for example some can reflect bullets (walls) while others don't.

Tiles are pre-rendered and distributed along with the game.

## Combat System
* Monsters only attack melee for now
* Players can equip one melee and one ranged weapon.
* Skills can influence both weapons and bullets.
* Damage reduction is applied after damage multipliers.

### Ranged Weapons
Ranged weapons use ammunitions that can be found in-game.

The bullet goes straight towards the direction the player is currently looking at until stopped or it expires.

Bullets inflict a damage per second, so the faster bullets are less effective.

|Weapon|Ammo|Dps|Speed|Lifespan|Cooldown|
|--|--|--|--|--|--|
|Kunai Launcher|Kunai|1500|7.0|1.4|0.15|
|AR15|.223 Rem|600|10.0|2.0|0.005|
|Cannon|Cannonball|5000|8.0|2.0|0.5|

### Melee Weapons
Melee weapons don't require ammunition, but the underlying mechanisms makes them fire invisible, slow and short-lived bullets, usually in a wider area than ranged weapons.

This category includes shields and all equipment that doesn't deal damage.

|Weapon|Dps|Speed|Lifespan|Cooldown|
|--|--|--|--|--|
|Sword|480|2.0|0.3|0.35|
|Shield|-20%|0.0|0.0|0.0|

### Monsters
There is a single kind of monster, but they can fuse to level up.

|Name|Dps|Hp|Speed|
|--|--|--|--|
|Blackberry|400|200|2.5|
|Blueberry|500|600|2.75|
|Strawberry|600|1300|3.02|
|Gooseberry|700|2000|3.33|


### Skills
The player can complete optional quests to gain special combat skills.
|Name|Effect|
|--|--|
|Bouncing Knife|Makes kunai bounce off walls, enemies, etc|
|Knife Catcher|Allows the player to put back in the inventory kunai that come back at him|
|Piercing Knife|Doubles damage dealt by kunais|

All skills are passive, stackable and perpetual.
