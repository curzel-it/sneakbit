# Game Description
> Warning!<br>
> This document contains game spoilers and AI generated slope and it's garbage in general.

## Overview
SneakBit game concept combines adventure and action elements, allowing players to explore a world populated by demons and to engage in combat with unique mechanics. The player can throw kunai (small knives) to defeat or weaken demonic creatures encountered throughout various landscapes, immersing the player in a journey with elements of both strategy and action wrapped in a gameboy-like pixel art aesthetics.

### Tiling System
The game operates on a grid-based tile system.
There are two types of tiles:
* Biomes, which act as a background (water, grass, lava, rocky pavement, parquet, ...)
* Constructions, which act as a second layer of elements on the map

Both kinds of tiles can represent an obstacle, the player cannot walk on water, lava and over fences for example, but can walk over grass.
To mimic the effect of density, different construction tiles have different properties, for example some can reflect bullets (walls) while others don't.

### Combat System
The only available weapon are throwing knifes.
Knifes can be found on the ground here and there, the player can pick them up by just walking by.
When pressing FIRE a knife is throw in the direction the player is currently looking at.
The bullet goes perfectly straight until stopped or it expires (3 seconds).

### Skills
The player can complete optional quests to gain special combat skills:
1. Bouncing Knife, which makes knifes bounce off walls, enemies, etc
1. Knife Catcher, which allows the player to put back in the inventory a knife that comes back at him
1. Piercing Knife, which allows knifes to kill immortal enemies and makes them stop bouncing off enemies (while still bouncing off walls)

All skills are passive, stackable and perpetual.

### Flora and Fauna
#### Manafren trees
The Manafern Trees, native to the twilight land of Duskhaven, are renowned for their mystical energy properties, marked by vibrant purple leaves that absorb ethereal particles from the soil and air. Through a unique, photosynthesis-like process, the Manaferns convert these particles into pure mana, illuminating the region and powering its ecosystem. However, a darker truth lies beneath their allure: a centuries-old pact with the Demon Lord has embedded fragments of his essence within the trees, making each pulse of mana a subtle extension of his influence. Though they enrich life in Duskhaven, the Manaferns also inch the world closer to his dominion, veiling a sinister force within their radiant glow.
